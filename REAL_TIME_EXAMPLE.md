# 🔄 Real-Time Newsletter Fetching

## How It Works (Every Page Load = Fresh Data)

```
1. User visits your website
   ↓
2. Browser loads the page
   ↓
3. JavaScript runs and calls: /api/mailchimp-proxy
   ↓
4. Vercel server fetches latest data from Mailchimp API
   ↓
5. Server returns fresh newsletter data to browser
   ↓
6. Website displays the latest newsletters
```

## ⚡ This Happens Every Single Time Someone Visits

- **No caching** (unless you want it)
- **No scheduled updates** 
- **No stale data**
- **Always fresh** from Mailchimp

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

- Your API key stays on Vercel server
- Never exposed to website visitors
- Rate limiting and validation on server
- CORS protection

## 🚀 Performance

- **First load**: ~200-500ms (API call to Mailchimp)
- **Subsequent loads**: Same speed (always fresh)
- **User experience**: Smooth loading with spinner

## Example Flow

**User visits at 2:00 PM:**
- Fetches newsletters sent up to 2:00 PM

**User visits at 4:00 PM:**
- Fetches newsletters sent up to 4:00 PM (including any new ones)

**User visits at 6:00 PM:**
- Fetches newsletters sent up to 6:00 PM (including any new ones)

**Every visit = Latest data!**
